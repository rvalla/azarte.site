			<h1>randomness</h1>
			<p>When you roll a die you know that a number from 1 to 6 will come up, but you don't know which one. When you
				flip a coin you know it won't turn into a bill but you can't be sure which side will be on top. You even know
				that if you throw a glass on the floor it will break into pieces, but you don't know exactly how many pieces.</p>

			<h1>light</h1>
			<p>One tends to use the camera to freeze the light. To record a moment as it was. But sometimes you can play a
				little with movement (either of the camera or the subject being photographed) to produce incredible images that
				surprise even the person shooting.</p>

			<h1>music</h1>
			<p>While in the <a href="en/musicalbackground.html">18th century</a> it was common to play at putting together
				musical pieces by rolling dice, it was during the <a href="en/musicalbackground.html">20th century</a> that
				chance was used more seriously to compose music. century when chance was used to compose music more seriously.
				I personally use it to construct musical pieces through games for which no musical training is required.</p>

			<h1>computer</h1>
			<p>The computer can generate random numbers and can do many more things. So it can be an incredible tool to use
				randomness creatively. You can turn a picture into a sound, you can mix thousands of images into one, you can
				simulate an epidemic and make a bunch of audio files into one, you can simulate an epidemic and make a bunch
				of audio files infect each other.</p>

			<h1>projects</h1>
			<p>Sometimes I wonder if it would be possible to create a sound from an image. Sometimes how would be a portrait
			after been altered with a chess game's moves. I work in different projects to test these ideas, from time to time.</p>
