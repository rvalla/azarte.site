			<h1>randomness</h1>
			<p>We say that something happens randomly when we cannot know in advance what is going to happen. We know that
				if we heat water in a pot at some point it will boil. That does not happen at random. On the other hand, if
				we flip a coin in the air it may come up heads or tails. We have no way of knowing which side of the coin is
				going to come up until we flip it.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box red">
			<h1>unpredictable or uncertain?</h1>
			<p>Perhaps if we flipped the coin with a special machine and we could measure very precisely its mass and the
				impulse we give it we could know which side it is going to fall on. Is it a random event to flip a coin then?
				As long as we don't know what is going to happen we say yes.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box green">
			<h1>you always know something</h1>
			<p>We will always know something. We won't know if it's going to rain in 60 days, but we do know that it will
				either rain, or not rain, or snow or hail. It rains, or it doesn't rain, or it snows or hails. No ice cream
				cones are going to fall from the sky. That's what makes using chance creatively so interesting.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box red">
			<h1>long term</h1>
			<p>If we roll a die we often expect to get about the same amount of each number. But we can roll two dice and
				keep the smaller one or roll three and keep the sum. This way we can control the distribution that the rolls
				will have.</p>
			<p>Try different options by clicking on the following box...</p>
