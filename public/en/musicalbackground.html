			<h1>nothing is totally new</h1>
			<p>Already in the 15th century  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Ockeghem">Johannes Ockeghem</a>
				wrote the mass <b>Cuiusvis Toni</b> which was written in such a way that it allowed the singers to decide in
				which mode to sing it (I am referring to the Gregorian modes: Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian or Mixolydian).
				Quite a counterpoint challenge.</p>

			<h1>playing with dice</h1>
			<p>During the 18th and 19th centuries it was common in Europe to play constructing musical pieces from a series
				of very short fragments. Rolling dice decided which of the fragments were used and in what order. The most
				famous example is <b>Musikalisches WÃ¼rfelspiel</b> by
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart">Mozart</a>.</p>

			<h1>20th century</h1>
			<p>In the second half of the 20th century the use of random procedures was much more marked. There are even
				different branches of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleatoric_music">aleatoric music</a>.
			In <b>Music of changes</b>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cage"> John Cage</a> uses the book of the
			<i>I ching</i> to construct the piece. The resulting score, however, is traditional. The pianist has well noted
			both the duration values and the pitches.</p>

			<h1>20th century</h1>
			<p>Many of the pieces of aleatoric music have an <i>open form</i>. In <b>Klavierstuck XI</b> composer
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlheinz_Stockhausen">Karlheinz Stockhausen</a> lets the pianist
				decide which fragment to play although each fragment conditions the character of the next one. In
			<b>Zyklus</b> a percussionist has to decide which way to read the score starting from anywhere.</p>

			<h1>20th century</h1>
			<p>Sometimes random procedures are used statistically. <i>Sound mass music</i> is constructed from many,
				many slightly different individual behaviors that together present an average sound.
				Perhaps the best example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Ligeti">Gyorgy Ligeti</a>'s
				<b>Symphonic Poem for 100 Metronomes</b> although it is not very aleatoric.</p>

			<h1>my games</h1>
			<p>The musical games I work on can be performed by people without formal musical training and produce stochastic
				pieces with textures typical of sound mass music. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Ligeti">Ligeti</a>
				seems to have been the first to propose a piece giving instructions in 1961 when he made the audience sing at
				an event by writing on a blackboard.</p>
