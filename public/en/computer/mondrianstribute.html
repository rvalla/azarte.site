			<h1>Piet Mondrian</h1>
			<p><a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian" target="_blank">Piet Mondrian</a> was born in 1872 in
			Amersfoort. He is considered one of the most important artists of last cetury. Perhaps his most famous paintings
			are those full of colored rectangles (which have even been transformed into dresses).</p>

			<h1>collaborative pieces</h1>
			<p>I invite you to participate in the creation of a collaborative work in his homage. To participate you will
			have to play a very simple game. The game has 4 levels and when you finish each one you will get a
			<i>Mondrian's strip</i>. I'm going to mix a lot of them to make some art works.</p>
			<p>You have to send me your strips (by <a href="mailto:rodrigovalla@protonmail.ch">mail</a> o through
			<a href="https://t.me/rvalla">telegram</a>). You will receive a digital copy of the work in which you have
			participated.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box blue">
			<h1>the game</h1>
			<p>The game consists of chasing four tunes. After clicking to start the program you will be able to start playing
			the melodies. The only thing you have to do is click every time you hear a sound. The images are downloaded
			automatically. Remember to send them to me! And share the game with your friends so we can pay a good tribute
			to Mondrian.</p>
